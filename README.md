K framework implementation of Hoon.

ISSUES:
 - Implicit brackets for cells not implemented.
 - wutcol should throw an error if the first argument doesn't evaluate to a boolean, but it doesn't.
 - @ud regular expression does not work properly.

TODO:
 - The subject.
 - Remaining runes.
 - Remaining auras.
